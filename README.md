Digital art gallery available at \href{https://www.deviantart.com/johnnyvirtual}{https://www.deviantart.com/johnnyvirtual} \section{Fun Fact} There are AIs that hack their simulation physics," Shane explains. "They have less human and more microbial nature, the way microbes will harvest energy from anything they find in their environment, whether it’s rocks, or heat, or chemicals, or sunlight. You find the same tendencies in very simple simulated organisms. They’ll harvest energy from math errors or slight inaccuracies in the simulation. \end{document}
